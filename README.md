## Overview
Smart T-Shirt Tracker is an AI-powered platform designed to raise awareness about the environmental impact of the fashion industry and provide actionable insights for sustainable choices. By analyzing clothing items, the system reveals their carbon footprint, recyclability, and offers personalized recommendations to optimize sustainability.

## Problem Statement
The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to global pollution, with textile waste and high carbon emissions posing serious environmental challenges. Consumers rarely have insight into the ecological impact of their purchases, resulting in unsustainable consumption patterns and a lack of actionable guidance for reducing their environmental footprint.

## Proposed Solution
Smart T-Shirt Tracker addresses this gap by leveraging AI and machine learning to:

### Analyze Environmental Impact
- Calculate the carbon footprint of individual garments.
- Determine whether a product is made from recycled materials.
- Assess post-consumer recyclability.

### Provide Actionable Recommendations
- Suggest appropriate recycling or upcycling methods.
- Recommend more sustainable alternatives or brands.
- Visualize potential environmental benefits of sustainable actions.

### Engage Users Through Simulations
- AI-powered visual simulations show how a garmentâ€™s environmental impact changes over time based on user actions.
- Encourage responsible consumption by making sustainability tangible and actionable.

## AI Integration
- **Image Recognition:** Identify garment types, materials, and labels from user-uploaded photos.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Estimate carbon footprint and recyclability based on material composition and production data.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggest sustainable actions and alternative products tailored to the userâ€™s wardrobe.

## Impact
- Educates consumers on the real-world environmental costs of fashion.
- Promotes responsible purchasing, recycling, and upcycling habits.
- Supports a more sustainable fashion ecosystem by bridging data-driven insights with actionable guidance.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with retail databases for real-time carbon footprint tracking.
- Gamification features to incentivize sustainable behavior.
- Community-driven platform for sharing upcycling ideas and success stories.
